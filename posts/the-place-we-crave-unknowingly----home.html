                    <p>Do you recall how enjoyable it was when that was transpiring? Notice how I didn’t specifically
                        mention any significant incident, yet you still thought about something that’s on your mind.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps this is lingering within your mind since morning? Isn’t it funny how trapped we are in
                        the entropy of our lives and we often find ourselves imagining a time when things were a bit
                        more normal, a bit better, or perhaps a bit quieter, don’t we?</p>
                    <p>Here’s a little-known secret: some of us wake up crying, not even knowing why. It’s for that
                        place, that feeling, or that time that doesn’t even exist. Yet, perhaps the probability of that
                        event happening is low, but it’s never zero, and that’s what haunts us. There’s a soul that
                        stirred within, making me yearn for a “home” I never knew. Never did I find myself homeless but
                        always homesick, yet I began to ache for its elusive embrace.</p>
                    <p>There are kindred souls, akin to me, pondering the same question. Some wonder, “Can I not return
                        to that home?” while others continue their quest, chasing after the elusive scent they
                        recognize, yet have never tasted.</p>
                    <p>Wait, hold on for a moment, you said “elusive” , so was it all , all in my mind , can I nit go
                        back to that place again ?</p>
                    <p>The answer I’ve discovered is that it isn’t entirely “elusive.” Some of us have lost faith within
                        ourselves, doubting if we’ll ever reunite with the home within. Some of us are still aching to
                        go back to the dream that they are having. But dear</p>
                    <p><em>Entropy does not change in a reversible system. In such systems, there is always as much
                            entropy absorbed as liberated. But it is difficult to find reversible systems in the
                            universe.</em></p>
                    <p>And there is also another way</p>
                    <p><em>According to the second law of thermodynamics, entropy in a closed system either remains
                            constant or increases. This means that entropy cannot be reversed globally in a closed
                            system. However, entropy can be reversed locally if the entropy can be put somewhere
                            else.</em></p>
                    <p>From a writer’s perspective, in the context of life, it’s akin to understanding that in certain
                        situations, there’s an equilibrium where the chaos and order balance out. However, achieving
                        such equilibrium is rare and often difficult in the complexity of our lives. The second law of
                        thermodynamics, in this metaphorical sense, suggests that overall, things tend to become more
                        disordered over time. Yet, on a smaller scale, we can sometimes mitigate this entropy by
                        redistributing it elsewhere, finding pockets of order amidst the chaos.</p>
                    <p>In the intricate tapestry of home, there exists a cyclical journey encompassing love, care,
                        generosity, tears, and moments of despair. It is a terrain marked by trials and tribulations,
                        where hearts are tested and spirits tempered. Yet, amidst the tumultuous tides of emotion, there
                        lies an unwavering resolve — a commitment to persevere, to weather the storms that threaten to
                        consume. For within the confines of home, the delicate equilibrium between chaos and love,
                        between hate and care, between anger and sorrow, is delicately balanced, as souls navigate the
                        labyrinth of human experience in search of solace and redemption.</p>
                    <p><em>Let us embrace the dance of the universe, where flux and flow intertwine.</em></p>
                    <p>Home can be found in unexpected places, like the Harry Potter series you bought but forgot, or in
                        the movies on your bucket list yet to watch. It might even hide in the food you always pass by.
                        Sometimes, home is a person you admire, or in the excitement of a puppy or kitten looking at
                        you. For some of us, the pursuit of that feeling runs so deep that we often miss it altogether.
                        If you heed my advice, cease the search open your heart to the dear ones and, without realizing
                        it, one day it will find you.</p>
                    <p>So let us embrace the flux, the ebb, and the flow,<br />For within this dynamic dance, mysteries
                        unfold.<br />In the poetry of chaos, we discover our art,<br />And in the symphony of life, find
                        solace for the heart.</p>
